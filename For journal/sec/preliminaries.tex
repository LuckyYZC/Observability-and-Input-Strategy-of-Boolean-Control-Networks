\section{Preliminaries} 
\label{sec:pre}
In this section we introduce the definition of \BCNs\ and their algebraic form, as well as the four existing types of observability.

\subsection{Boolean Control Networks}

A Boolean control network can be described as a directed graph together with logical equations to describe the updating rules of the nodes. The formal definition of \BCN\ is given as follows. 

\begin{definition}[Boolean Control Networks] A \BCN\ consists of its topology and its updating rules.\cite{Ideker2001A}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Topology:  A directed graph consists of input-nodes, state-nodes, output-nodes, and directed edges which connect nodes. 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item A node in \BCN\ can take a logic value from $\{0,1\}$ at a discrete time $t=0, 1, 2,\ldots$ 
	
	\item A directed edge from a state-node $s_1$ (or an input-node $i_1$) to a state-node $s_2$ means that the logic value of $s_2$ at time step $t+1$ is affected by the value of $s_1$ (or $i_1$)  at time step $t$. 
	
	\item A directed edge from a state-node $s_1$ to an output-node $o_1$ means that the logic value of $o_1$ at time step $t$ is affected by the value of $s_1$  at time step $t$.  
	\end{itemize}
  \item Updating rules: We suppose that a \BCN\ has $n$ state-nodes, $m$ input-nodes and $q$ output-nodes. Then the updating rules of the \BCN\ can be described as following formulas:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
s(t+1)=&f(i(t),s(t))\\
o(t)=&h(s(t))
\end{split}
\label{equ:1}
\end{equation}
that $s(t)\in \mathbb{B}^n$ are state-nodes; $i(t)\in \mathbb{B}^m$ are input-nodes; $o(t)\in \mathbb{B}^q$ are output-nodes; $f:\mathbb{B}^{n+m}\mapsto \mathbb{B}^n$ and $h:\mathbb{B}^n\mapsto \mathbb{B}^q$ are logical functions that represent the updating rules of {\em BCNs}. Where $\mathbb{B}$ : the set $\{0,1\}$; $t=0,1,\ldots$ represents the discrete time. 
\end{itemize}

\end{definition}


%Note that one can only know that whether a node is affected by another node from the network graph. Different \BCNs\ may have the same structure, in order to determine a \BCN\ uniquely,

      \caption{A Boolean control network with two input-nodes $A$ and $B$, four state-nodes $C$, $D$, $E$ and $F$, and two output-nodes $G$, $W$. We use blue, black and orange, to distinguish three types of nodes and three types of edges.}
      \label{fig:1}
  \end{figure}

%To better illustrate the concept of {\em BCNs}, we give a simple example to describe it.

\begin{example}
In Fig.\ref{fig:1} we have a \BCN\ with two input-nodes $A$ and $B$, four state-nodes $C$, $D$, $E$ and $F$, two output-nodes $G$, $W$ and the directed edges which connect them. And we have the updating rules (\ref{equ:1}) of this \BCN\ that \[C(t), D(t), E(t), F(t)\in s(t)\] denote the value of state-nodes at in time step $t$;
\[A(t), B(t)\in i(t)\] denote the value of input-nodes at in time step $t$;
\[G(t), W(t)\in o(t)\] denote the value of output-nodes at in time step $t$;
$f:\mathbb{B}^{6}\mapsto \mathbb{B}^4$ and $h:\mathbb{B}^4\mapsto \mathbb{B}^2$ from the truth table (Fig.\ref{fig:2}).  For instance, the updating rule of output-node $G$ is 
\[G(t)=C(t)\wedge \neg(\neg{D(t)}\wedge \neg E(t)\wedge \neg F(t))\]
	
The reason why we use the truth table to describe the updating rules of the \BCN\ is that it would be will be more convenient for a \BCN\ to be converted into its aglebraic form. What's more, for convenience, we will use this example to explain various concepts throughout this paper.

\subsection{The algebraic forms of \BCNs}
As mentioned in the {\em Section \ref{sec:intro}}, \STP\ is one of useful tools to deal with  both \BNs\ and \BCNs\  related problems \cite{cheng2009controllability}. The \STP\ is used to represent the algebraic form of \BCN. The algebraic form of \BCN\ helps us to introduce four existing observability of \BCN\ and define the online observability of \BCN. The definition of \STP\ is as follows.

\begin{definition}[STP] 
	\cite{Cheng2011Analysis} Let $X\in\mathbb{R}_{m\times n}$, $Y\in\mathbb{R}_{p\times q}$ and $\alpha=lcm(n,p)$ be the least common multiple of $n$ and $p$. The \STP\ of $X$ and $Y$ is defined as \[X\ltimes Y=(X\otimes I_{\alpha/n})(Y\otimes I_{\alpha/p}),\] where $\otimes$ denotes the {\em Kronecker product}. 
\end{definition}

After introducing the definition of \STP\ of matrices,  we introduce some related notations at first \cite{Zhang2016Observability}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\delta^i_n$: the $i$-th column of the identity matrix $I_n$;
  \item $\Delta_n$: the set $\{\delta^1_n,\ldots,\delta^n_n \}$; 
  \item $\delta_n \left[i_1,\ldots,i_s\right]$: $\left[\delta^{i_1}_n,\ldots,\delta^{i_s}_n\right]\left(i_1,\ldots,i_s\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,n\right\}\right)$ the logical matrix;
  \item  $L_{n\times s}$: the set of $n\times s$ logical matrices.
\end{itemize}

Using \STP\ of matrices, the updating rules of the \BCN\ (\ref{equ:1}) can be quivalently represented in the following algebraic form:
\begin{definition}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
s(t+1)=&\ L\ltimes{i(t)}\ltimes{s(t)}\\
o(t)=&\ H\ltimes{s(t)}
\end{split}
\label{equ:2}
\end{equation}
where $s(t)\in\Delta_N$, $i(t)\in\Delta_M$, and  $o(t)\in\Delta_Q$ denote the states, inputs and outputs respectively the same as in formula (\ref{equ:1}), but $s(t)$, $i(t)$ and $o(t)$ in formula (\ref{equ:2}) would be written in special vector forms; $L\in L_{N\times\left(NM\right)}$ and $H\in L_{Q\times N}$ denote the relation matrices, where $N=2^n$, $M=2^m$, and $Q=2^q$. 
\end{definition}

Since \STP\ keeps most properties of the conventional product \cite{Cheng2011Analysis}, the associative law, the distributive law, etc., we usually omit the symbol ``$\ltimes$'' hereinafter. For instance, the 
formula \[s(t+1)=L\ltimes{i(t)}\ltimes{s(t)}\] will be written as  \[s(t+1)=L{i(t)}{s(t)}.\]

After the introduction of the algebraic forms of \BCNs, we introduce the process of constructing a \BCN\' s algebraic form. In order to construct the algebraic form of \BCN\ (\ref{equ:2}) we give a mapping $\tau:\{0,1\}\mapsto \{\delta_2^1, \delta_2^2\}$ where $\tau(0)=\delta_2^2$, $\tau(1)= \delta_2^1$. 
%each logical value a vector form as: $1 \scriptsize{\sim} \delta_2^1$, $0 \scriptsize{\sim} \delta_2^2$. 
Therefore, the logical variable $A(t)$ takes value from these two vectors, i.e., $A(t)\in \{\delta_2^1, \delta_2^2\}$. Using the \STP\ of matrices, we have 
\[i(t)=i_1(t){\ldots}i_m(t);\] 
\[s(t)=s_1(t){\ldots}s_n(t);\] 
\[o(t)=o_1(t){\ldots}o_q(t).\] 
And according to \cite{Cheng2003Semi}, for the logical function of each state-node $f_p$ which can be found in the updating rules (\ref{equ:1}). The form of  $f_p$ as:
\[f_p(i_1(t),\ldots,i_m(t),s_1(t),\ldots,s_n(t))\] 
there exists a structure matrix $L_p\in L_{2\times {NM}}$ such that
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\tau(f_p(i_1(t),\ldots,i_m(t),s_1(t),\ldots,s_n(t)))= L_pi(t)s(t)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%where the left side of equation calculate the truth value and the  right side of equation calculate the vector in $\{\delta_2^1, \delta_2^2\}$. 
Therefore for state-nodes $s_1,\ldots,s_n$, we have $n$ logical matrices $L_1,\ldots,L_n$ for them, respectively. 
%We have that
%when\\
If for each state-node $s_p$ the logical matrix has its form
\[L_p=[\delta_2^{p_1},\ldots,\delta_2^{p_{NM}}],\] 
then we have that %for the set of all state-nodes $s(t)$ the logical matrix 
\[L=[\delta_N^{R_1},\ldots,\delta_N^{R_{NM}}]\]  where 
\[\delta_N^{R_1}=\delta_2^{1_1}\ldots\delta_2^{n_1};\ldots; \delta_N^{R_{NM}}=\delta_2^{1_{NM}}\ldots\delta_2^{n_{NM}}.\] 
%then 
By this relationship we can construct the $L$ for the algebraic forms of \BCNs. What's more we can also construct the logical matrix $H$ in the similar way. To better illustrate the concept of algebraic forms, we give a simple example to describe it.
\begin{example}
For instance, the \BCN\ whose structure is depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:1}, and the updating rules of this \BCN\ is described as truth table in Fig.\ref{fig:2}. We have that the updating rules of this \BCN\ can be represented with the algebraic form:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
s(t+1) =&\delta_{16}[\alpha]i(t)s(t)\\
o(t) =&\delta_4[\beta]s(t)\\
\end{split}
\label{equ:4}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha=\{10,4,11,16,9,5,1, 7,15,2,3,12,7,6,8,13,8,9,\\15,10,14,4,3,16,1,14,12,13,5,7,2,6,7,2,3,13,13,9,5,1,\\16,13 ,6,14,11,10,4,15,1,14 ,7,6,9 ,8,11,12,5,5,13,3,10,\\12,16,16\}$, $\beta=\{1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\}$, $t\in \mathbb{N}$, $s\in \Delta_{16}$, $i\in \Delta_4$ and $o\in \Delta_4$.
\end{example}   
\subsection{Four existing observability of \BCNs}
After introducing the algebraic forms of \BCNs, we introduce four existing types of observability of \BCNs\ in this subsection. In order to introduce four existing types of observability of {\em BCNs}, we define the mappings \cite{Zhang2016Observability}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
L^p_{s_0} &: (\Delta_M)^p\mapsto(\Delta_N)^p, i_0\ldots i_{p-1} \mapsto s_1 \ldots\, s_p\\
L^{\infty}_{s_0} &: (\Delta_M)^{\infty}\mapsto(\Delta_N)^{\infty}, i_0 i_1 \ldots  \mapsto s_1 s_2 \ldots
\end{split}
\label{equ:5}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(HL)^p_{s_0} &: (\Delta_M)^p\mapsto(\Delta_Q)^p, i_0\ldots i_{p-1} \mapsto o_1\ldots\, o_p\\
(HL)^{\infty}_{s_0} &: (\Delta_M)^{\infty}\mapsto(\Delta_Q)^{\infty}, i_0 i_1 \ldots  \mapsto o_1 o_2\ldots
\end{split}
\label{equ:6}
\end{equation}

Where $\Delta_N$, $\Delta_M$ and $\Delta_Q$ are three alphabets, $s_0\in \Delta_N$, $p\in \mathbb{Z}_+$ and $\infty$ is the infinite natural numbers. For all  $p\in \mathbb{Z}_+$, \[I=i_0 \ldots i_{p-1} \in(\Delta_M)^p\] is an input sequence, \[L^p_{s_0}(I)=s_1 \ldots s_{p} \in(\Delta_N)^p\] is a state sequence and \[(HL)^p_{s_0}=o_1 \ldots o_{p} \in(\Delta_N)^p\] is a output sequence. For the $\infty$, \[I=i_0 \ldots  \in(\Delta_M)^{\infty}\] is an infinitely long input sequence, \[L^{\infty}_{s_0}(I)=s_1 \ldots  \in(\Delta_N)^{\infty}\] is an infinitely long state sequence and \[(HL)^{\infty}_{s_0}(I)=o_1 \ldots \in(\Delta_N)^{\infty}\] is an infinitely long output sequence. In the formula (\ref{equ:5}), for any $1\le k \le |I|$ we have \[s_k=Li_{k-1}s_{k-1}.\] In the formula (\ref{equ:5}) and formula (\ref{equ:6}), for any $1\le k \le |I|$ we have  \[o_k=Hs_k=HLi_{k-1}s_{k-1}.\] Then four existing types of observability of BCNs can be define as: 
%And for all $1\ge k \ge j \ge |I|$, we use I[k,j] to denote the word $i_k \ldots i_j$ as an input sequence. 
\begin{definition}
The first type of observability is that, \BCN\ is called observable, if for every initial state $s_0 \in \Delta_N$, there exists an input sequence $I\in(\Delta_M)^p$ for some $p\in \mathbb{Z}_+$ such that for all states $s_0\neq {s'}_0\in \Delta_N$, $Hs_0=H{s'}_0$ implies $(HL)^p_{s_0}(I)\neq (HL)^p_{{s'}_0}(I)$ \cite{cheng2009controllability}.
\end{definition}

Hence the first observability means that if a \BCN\ is observable then every initial state of the \BCN\ can be determined by an input sequence. But we can only use the corresponding input sequence of a state to check whether it is the initial state of this {\em BCN} or not.
\begin{example}
For example, the \BCN\ whose structure is depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:1}, and the updating rules of this \BCN\ is described as truth table in Fig.\ref{fig:2}.  We have for every initial state of this \BCN\ can be determined by an input sequence.  For instance,
\begin{itemize}
  \item the state $\delta_{16}^1$ can be determined by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^4$, $\delta_{4}^1 \delta_{4}^3$ and $\delta_{4}^1 \delta_{4}^4$, etc;
  \item the state $\delta_{16}^2$ can be determined by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^1$, $\delta_{4}^3$ and $\delta_{4}^4$, etc;
  \item the state $\delta_{16}^2$ can be determined by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^2$, $\delta_{4}^4$and $\delta_{4}^1 \delta_{4}^4$, etc.
\end{itemize} 
Therefore we have this \BCN\ satisfies the existing first observability.
\end{example}   

\begin{definition}
	The second type of observability is that, a \BCN\ is called observable if for any distinct states $s_0$, ${s'}_0 \in \Delta_N$, there exists an input sequence $I\in(\Delta_M)^p$ for some $p\in \mathbb{Z}_+$, such that $Hs_0=H{s'}_0$ implies $(HL)^p_{s_0}(I)\neq (HL)^p_{{s'}_0}(I)$ \cite{Zhao2010Input}.
\end{definition}

The second observability means that a \BCN\ is called observable if for every two distinct initial states of the  \BCN, there exists an input sequence which can distinguish them. 
\begin{example}
The \BCN\ whose structure is depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:1}, and the updating rules of this \BCN\ is described as truth table in Fig.\ref{fig:2}.  We have for every two distinct initial states of the \BCN, there exists an input sequence which can distinguish them.  For instance,
\begin{itemize}
  \item the states $\delta_{16}^1$ and $\delta_{16}^2$ can be distinguished by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^1$, $\delta_{4}^2 \delta_{4}^1$ and $\delta_{4}^2 \delta_{4}^2$, etc;
  \item the states $\delta_{16}^1$ and $\delta_{16}^3$  can be distinguished by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^2$, $\delta_{4}^3$ and $\delta_{4}^4$, etc;
  \item the states $\delta_{16}^2$ and $\delta_{16}^3$  can be distinguished by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^1$, $\delta_{4}^2$and $\delta_{4}^4$, etc.
\end{itemize} 
Therefore we have this \BCN\ satisfies the existing second observability.
\end{example}   
\begin{definition}
	The third type of observability is that, a \BCN\ is called observable, if there exists an input sequence $I\in(\Delta_M)^p$ for some $p\in \mathbb{Z}_+$, such that for any distinct states $s_0$, ${s'}_0 \in \Delta_N$, $Hs_0=H{s'}_0$ implies $(HL)^p_{s_0}(I)\neq (HL)^p_{{s'}_0}(I)$ \cite{Cheng2011Identification}.
\end{definition}

The third observability means that a \BCN\ is called observable if there is an input sequence that determines the initial state of the {\em BCN}.

\begin{example}
The \BCN\ whose structure is depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:1}, and the updating rules of this \BCN\ is described as truth table in Fig.\ref{fig:2}.  We have for every two distinct initial states of the \BCN, there exists an input sequence which can distinguish them.  For instance,
\begin{itemize}
  \item the states $\delta_{16}^1$ and $\delta_{16}^2$ can be distinguished by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^1$, $\delta_{4}^2 \delta_{4}^1$ and $\delta_{4}^2 \delta_{4}^2$, etc;
  \item the states $\delta_{16}^1$ and $\delta_{16}^3$  can be distinguished by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^2$, $\delta_{4}^3$ and $\delta_{4}^4$, etc;
  \item the states $\delta_{16}^2$ and $\delta_{16}^3$  can be distinguished by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^1$, $\delta_{4}^2$and $\delta_{4}^4$, etc.
\end{itemize} 
Therefore we have this \BCN\ satisfies the existing second observability.
\end{example}  
\begin{definition}
	The fourth type of observability is that, \BCN\ is called observable, if for any distinct states $s_0$, ${s'}_0 \in \Delta_N$, for any input sequence $I\in(\Delta_M)^{\infty}$, $Hs_0=H{s'}_0$ implies $(HL)^{\infty}_{s_0}(I)\neq (HL)^{\infty}_{{s'}_0}(I)$ \cite{Fornasini2013Observability}.
\end{definition}

The fourth observability means that a \BCN\ is called observable if every sufficient long input sequence can determine the initial state of the \BCN.
\begin{example}
The \BCN\ whose structure is depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:1}, and the updating rules of this \BCN\ is described as truth table in Fig.\ref{fig:2}.  We have for every two distinct initial states of the \BCN, there exists an input sequence which can distinguish them.  For instance,
\begin{itemize}
  \item the states $\delta_{16}^1$ and $\delta_{16}^2$ can be distinguished by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^1$, $\delta_{4}^2 \delta_{4}^1$ and $\delta_{4}^2 \delta_{4}^2$, etc;
  \item the states $\delta_{16}^1$ and $\delta_{16}^3$  can be distinguished by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^2$, $\delta_{4}^3$ and $\delta_{4}^4$, etc;
  \item the states $\delta_{16}^2$ and $\delta_{16}^3$  can be distinguished by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^1$, $\delta_{4}^2$and $\delta_{4}^4$, etc.
\end{itemize} 
Therefore we have this \BCN\ satisfies the existing second observability.
\end{example}  
Then from the definitions of  four existing types of observability, we know that \cite{Zhang2016Observability}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the first one implies the second one;
  \item the third one implies the second one and first one;
  \item the fourth one implies the third one, second one and first one.
\end{itemize} 
%, when we don't presuppose the initial state of {\em BCNs}
 
We can not use the first one and second one to determine the initial state of some \BCNs\ which can be checked at most once. For example, in the first type observability we need to assume the initial state of a \BCN, and then check it by corresponding input sequence of this state. If the initial state we assume is correct, then we can determine the initial state. But if the the assumption is not correct, we can not determine the initial state of the \BCN. Therefore we need to check several test cases (with the same initial state) of this \BCN\ untill we can determine the initial state of it. However we can use the third existing observability and fourth existing observability to determine the initial state of \BCNs\ through one test case. And we need not to presuppose the initial state of \BCNs\ when we use the third observability and fourth observability. But the requirements for \BCNs\ are very harsh when we use the third observability and fourth observability.
 
In some biological systems, the initial state of them can be checked at most once, i.e., we can only check the initial state of some biological systems (depicted by \BCNs) in real time. Therefore, we can not use the first observability and second observability to determine the initial states of them in real time. And in some biological systems, it would takes many costs to check these biological systems. Hence we will spend a lot of overhead to determine the initial states of them by the first observability and second observability. Furthermore, we also can not use the third observability and fourth observability to determine the initial states of some biological systems when they can not satify the requirements of the third observability and fourth observability. With these disadvantages of four existing observability, we propose the online observability of \BCNs\ to solve this problem.
