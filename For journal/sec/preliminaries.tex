\section{Preliminaries} 
\label{sec:pre}
In this section we introduce the definition of \BCNs\ and their algebraic forms, as well as the four existing types of observability. 

$\mathbb{B}$ : the set $\{0,1\}$; $t=0,1,\ldots$ represents the discrete time. 

\subsection{Boolean Control Networks}

A Boolean control network can be defined as a directed graph together with logical equations to describe the updating rules of the nodes of the directed graph. The formal definition of \BCN\ is given as follows. 

\begin{definition}[Boolean Control Networks, \cite{Ideker2001A}] A \BCN\ consists of the  topology and the associated updating rules. The topology is captured by a directed graph which consists of input-nodes, state-nodes, output-nodes, and directed edges which connect nodes. 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Every node in a \BCN\ can take a logic value from $\{0,1\}$ at a discrete time $t=0, 1, 2,\ldots$ 
	
	\item Every directed edge from a state-node $s_1$ (or an input-node $i_1$) to a state-node $s_2$ means that the logic value of $s_2$ at time step $t+1$ is affected by the logic value of $s_1$ (or $i_1$)  at time step $t$. 
	
	\item Every directed edge from a state-node $s_1$ to an output-node $o_1$ means that the logic value of $o_1$ at time step $t$ is affected by the logic value of $s_1$  at time step $t$.  
	\end{itemize}

Assuming that the \BCN\ has $n$ state-nodes, $m$ input-nodes and $q$ output-nodes. Then the updating rules of the \BCN\ can be described as following formulas:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
s(t+1)=&f(i(t),s(t))\\
o(t)=&h(s(t))
\end{split}
\label{equ:1}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $s(t)\in \mathbb{B}^n$ is a state which represent the logic value of all state-nodes at time step $t$; 	
	\item $i(t)\in \mathbb{B}^m$ is an input which represent the logic value of all input-nodes at time step $t$; 	
	\item $o(t)\in \mathbb{B}^q$ is an output which represent the logic value of all output-nodes at time step $t$;  
	\item $f:\mathbb{B}^{n+m}\mapsto \mathbb{B}^n$ and $h:\mathbb{B}^n\mapsto \mathbb{B}^q$ are logical functions that represent the updating rules of the {\em BCN}. 
	\end{itemize}
%Where $\mathbb{B}$ : the set $\{0,1\}$; $t=0,1,\ldots$ represents the discrete time. 
 

\end{definition}

In order to better illustrate the definition of BCN, we give an example as follows.

%Note that one can only know that whether a node is affected by another node from the network graph. Different \BCNs\ may have the same structure, in order to determine a \BCN\ uniquely,

      \caption{A Boolean control network with two input-nodes $A$ and $B$, four state-nodes $C$, $D$, $E$ and $F$, and two output-nodes $G$, $W$. We use blue, black and orange, to distinguish three types of nodes and three types of edges.}
      \label{fig:1}
  \end{figure}

%To better illustrate the concept of {\em BCNs}, we give a simple example to describe it.

\begin{example}
In Fig.\ref{fig:1} we have a \BCN\ with two input-nodes $A$ and $B$, four state-nodes $C$, $D$, $E$ and $F$, two output-nodes $G$, $W$ and the directed edges which connect them. And we have the updating rules of this \BCN\ that \[C(t), D(t), E(t), F(t)\in s(t)\] denote the value of state-nodes at time step $t$;
\[A(t), B(t)\in i(t)\] denote the value of input-nodes at time step $t$;
\[G(t), W(t)\in o(t)\] denote the value of output-nodes at time step $t$;
The updating rules $f:\mathbb{B}^{6}\mapsto \mathbb{B}^4$ and $h:\mathbb{B}^4\mapsto \mathbb{B}^2$ are shown in the truth table (Fig.\ref{fig:2}).  For instance, the updating rule of output-node $G$ is 
\[G(t)=C(t)\overline{(\overline{D}(t)\overline{ E}(t)\overline{F}(t))}.\]
And the updating rule of state-node $C$ is 

$C(t+1)=
(\overline{A}(t)D(t) (\overline{B}(t) \overline{F}(t) (\overline{C}(t) + \overline{E}(t)) + C(t)(B(t)E(t)+F(t)))
+(A(t)(\overline{D}(t)(\overline{B}(t)\overline{C}(t)+\overline{E}(t)F(t)+\overline{C}(t)F(t))+B(t)E(t)\overline{F}(t)))
+(\overline{B}(t)E(t)(C(t)\overline{D}(t)\overline{F}(t)+D(t)F(t)))
(B(t)\overline{E}(t)(\overline{C}(t)F(t)+C(t)\overline{D}(t)))$.

%\[C(t+1)=(A(t)\wedge B(t))\vee (C(t)\wedge D(t))\vee (E(t)\wedge F(t))\]
The reason why we use the truth table to describe the updating rules of the \BCN\ is that it would be will be more convenient for a \BCN\ to be converted into its aglebraic form. And we will use this example to explain various concepts throughout this paper.

\subsection{The algebraic forms of \BCNs}
As mentioned in the {\em Section \ref{sec:intro}}, \STP\ is one of useful tools to deal with  both \BNs\ and \BCNs\  related problems \cite{cheng2009controllability}. The \STP\ is used to represent the algebraic form of \BCN. The algebraic form of \BCN\ helps us to introduce four existing observability of \BCN\ and define the online observability of \BCN. The definition of \STP\ is as follows.

\begin{definition}[STP] 
	\cite{Cheng2011Analysis} Let $X\in\mathbb{R}_{m\times n}$, $Y\in\mathbb{R}_{p\times q}$ and $\alpha=lcm(n,p)$ be the least common multiple of $n$ and $p$. The \STP\ of $X$ and $Y$ is defined as \[X\ltimes Y=(X\otimes I_{\alpha/n})(Y\otimes I_{\alpha/p}),\] where $\otimes$ denotes the {\em Kronecker product}. 
\end{definition}

After introducing the definition of \STP\ of matrices,  we introduce some related notations \cite{Zhang2016Observability}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\delta^i_n$: the $i$-th column of the identity matrix $I_n$;
  \item $\Delta_n$: the set $\{\delta^1_n,\ldots,\delta^n_n \}$; 
  \item $\delta_n \left[i_1,\ldots,i_s\right]$: $\left[\delta^{i_1}_n,\ldots,\delta^{i_s}_n\right]\left(i_1,\ldots,i_s\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,n\right\}\right)$ the logical matrix;
  \item  $L_{n\times s}$: the set of $n\times s$ logical matrices.
\end{itemize}

Using \STP\ of matrices, the updating rules of the \BCN\ (\ref{equ:1}) can be quivalently represented in the following algebraic form:
\begin{definition}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
s(t+1)=&\ L\ltimes{i(t)}\ltimes{s(t)}\\
o(t)=&\ H\ltimes{s(t)}
\end{split}
\label{equ:2}
\end{equation}
where $s(t)\in\Delta_N$, $i(t)\in\Delta_M$, and  $o(t)\in\Delta_Q$ denote the states, inputs and outputs respectively similar to those in formula (\ref{equ:1}), but $s(t)$, $i(t)$ and $o(t)$ in formula (\ref{equ:2}) written in special vector forms; $L\in L_{N\times\left(NM\right)}$ and $H\in L_{Q\times N}$ denote the relation matrices, where $N=2^n$, $M=2^m$, and $Q=2^q$. 
\end{definition}

Since \STP\ keeps most properties of the conventional product \cite{Cheng2011Analysis}, the associative law, the distributive law, etc., we usually omit the symbol ``$\ltimes$'' hereinafter. For instance, the 
formula \[s(t+1)=L\ltimes{i(t)}\ltimes{s(t)}\] will be written as  \[s(t+1)=L{i(t)}{s(t)}.\]

After the introduction of the algebraic forms of \BCNs, we introduce the process of constructing a \BCN\' s algebraic form. In order to construct the algebraic form of \BCN\ (\ref{equ:2}) we give a mapping \[\tau:\{0,1\}\mapsto \{\delta_2^1, \delta_2^2\},\] where $\tau(0)=\delta_2^2$, $\tau(1)= \delta_2^1$. 
%each logical value a vector form as: $1 \scriptsize{\sim} \delta_2^1$, $0 \scriptsize{\sim} \delta_2^2$. 
Therefore, a logical variable of a node e.g. the input-node $A$ of \BCN\ in {\em Example \ref{exa:2}} takes value from these two vectors, i.e., $A(t)\in \{\delta_2^1, \delta_2^2\}$. Using the \STP\ of matrices, we have 
\[i(t)=i_1(t)\ltimes {\ldots}\ltimes i_m(t);\] 
\[s(t)=s_1(t)\ltimes {\ldots}\ltimes s_n(t);\] 
\[o(t)=o_1(t)\ltimes {\ldots}\ltimes o_q(t).\] 
And according to \cite{Cheng2003Semi}, for the logical function $f_p$ of each state-node which can be found in the updating rules (\ref{equ:1}) that
\[s_p(t+1)=f_p(i_1(t),\ldots,i_m(t),s_1(t),\ldots,s_n(t)),\] 
there exists a logical matrix $L_p\in L_{2\times {NM}}$ such that
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
\[\tau(f_p(i_1(t),\ldots,i_m(t),s_1(t),\ldots,s_n(t)))= L_pi(t)s(t)\]
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%where the left side of equation calculate the truth value and the  right side of equation calculate the vector in $\{\delta_2^1, \delta_2^2\}$. 
Therefore for state-nodes $s_1,\ldots,s_n$, we have $n$ corresponding logical matrices $L_1,\ldots,L_n$ for them, respectively. 
%We have that
%when\\
If for each state-node $s_p$ the logical matrix has its form
\[L_p=[\delta_2^{p_1},\ldots,\delta_2^{p_{NM}}],\] 
then we have that %for the set of all state-nodes $s(t)$ the logical matrix 
\[L=[\delta_N^{R_1},\ldots,\delta_N^{R_{NM}}]\]  where 
\[\delta_N^{R_1}=\delta_2^{1_1}\ltimes \ldots \ltimes \delta_2^{n_1};\]\[\vdots\] \[\delta_N^{R_{NM}}=\delta_2^{1_{NM}}\ltimes \ldots \ltimes \delta_2^{n_{NM}}.\] 

%then 

By this relationship we can construct the $L$ for the algebraic forms of \BCNs. And then we can construct the logical matrix $H$ in the similar way. To better illustrate the concept of algebraic forms, we give a simple example to describe it.
\begin{example}
For instance, for the \BCN\ mentioned in {\em Example \ref{exa:2}}, we have that the updating rules of this \BCN\ can be represented with the algebraic form:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
s(t+1) =&\delta_{16}[\alpha]i(t)s(t)\\
o(t) =&\delta_4[\beta]s(t)\\
\end{split}
\label{equ:4}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha=\{10,4,11,16,9,5,1, 7,15,2,3,12,7,6,8,13,8,9,\\15,10,14,4,3,16,1,14,12,13,5,7,2,6,7,2,3,13,13,9,5,1,\\16,13 ,6,14,11,10,4,15,1,14 ,7,6,9 ,8,11,12,5,5,13,3,10,\\12,16,16\}$, $\beta=\{1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\}$, $t\in \mathbb{N}$, $s\in \Delta_{16}$, $i\in \Delta_4$ and $o\in \Delta_4$.

And then we have its algebraic form shown by table (Fig.\ref{fig:6}) that the unit of $i(t)$ and $o(t)$ is $\delta_{4}^i$ and the unit of $s(t)$ is $\delta_{16}^i$. For instance, when $s(t)=\delta_{16}^1$ and  $i(t)=\delta_{4}^1$, it means that the values of all state-nodes and all input-nodes in time step $t$ are $1$,  from the true table (Fig.\ref{fig:2}) we have $C(t+1)=0$, $D(t+1)=1$, $E(t+1)=1$ and $F(t+1)=0$. Thus we have \[s(t+1)=\delta_{2}^2 \ltimes \delta_{2}^1 \ltimes \delta_{2}^1 \ltimes \delta_{2}^2=\delta_{16}^{10}.\]
 \begin{figure}[thpb]
      \centering

      \caption{The algebraic form of the \BCN\ shown in Fig.\ref{fig:1}.}
      \label{fig:6}
   \end{figure}
\end{example}   


\subsection{Four existing observability of \BCNs}
After introducing the algebraic forms of \BCNs, we introduce four existing types of observability of \BCNs\ in this subsection. In order to introduce four existing types of observability of \BCNs, we define the mappings \cite{Zhang2016Observability}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
L^p_{s_0} &: (\Delta_M)^p\mapsto(\Delta_N)^p, i_0\ldots i_{p-1} \mapsto s_1 \ldots\, s_p\\
L^{\infty}_{s_0} &: (\Delta_M)^{\infty}\mapsto(\Delta_N)^{\infty}, i_0 i_1 \ldots  \mapsto s_1 s_2 \ldots
\end{split}
\label{equ:5}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(HL)^p_{s_0} &: (\Delta_M)^p\mapsto(\Delta_Q)^p, i_0\ldots i_{p-1} \mapsto o_1\ldots\, o_p\\
(HL)^{\infty}_{s_0} &: (\Delta_M)^{\infty}\mapsto(\Delta_Q)^{\infty}, i_0 i_1 \ldots  \mapsto o_1 o_2\ldots
\end{split}
\label{equ:6}
\end{equation}

Where $\Delta_N$, $\Delta_M$ and $\Delta_Q$ are three alphabets, $s_0\in \Delta_N$, $p\in \mathbb{Z}_+$ and $\infty$ is the infinite natural numbers. For all  $p\in \mathbb{Z}_+$, \[I=i_0 \ldots i_{p-1} \in(\Delta_M)^p\] is an input sequence, \[L^p_{s_0}(I)=s_1 \ldots s_{p} \in(\Delta_N)^p\] is a state sequence and \[(HL)^p_{s_0}=o_1 \ldots o_{p} \in(\Delta_N)^p\] is a output sequence. For the $\infty$, \[I=i_0 \ldots  \in(\Delta_M)^{\infty}\] is an infinitely long input sequence, \[L^{\infty}_{s_0}(I)=s_1 \ldots  \in(\Delta_N)^{\infty}\] is an infinitely long state sequence and \[(HL)^{\infty}_{s_0}(I)=o_1 \ldots \in(\Delta_N)^{\infty}\] is an infinitely long output sequence. From the algebraic forms of \BCNs, in the formula (\ref{equ:5}), for any $1\le k \le |I|$ we have \[s_k=Li_{k-1}s_{k-1}.\] In the formula (\ref{equ:5}) and formula (\ref{equ:6}), for any $1\le k \le |I|$ we have  \[o_k=Hs_k=HLi_{k-1}s_{k-1}.\] 

Then four existing types of observability of BCNs can be defined as follows.
%And for all $1\ge k \ge j \ge |I|$, we use I[k,j] to denote the word $i_k \ldots i_j$ as an input sequence. 
\begin{definition}
The first type of observability is that, a \BCN\ is called observable, if for every initial state $s_0 \in \Delta_N$, there exists an input sequence $I\in(\Delta_M)^p$ for some $p\in \mathbb{Z}_+$ such that for every two states $s_0\neq {s'}_0\in \Delta_N$, $Hs_0=H{s'}_0$ implies $(HL)^p_{s_0}(I)\neq (HL)^p_{{s'}_0}(I)$ \cite{cheng2009controllability}.
\end{definition}

Hence the first observability means that if a \BCN\ is observable then every initial state of the \BCN\ can be determined by an input sequence. But we can only use the corresponding input sequence $I_i$ of a state $s_i$ to check whether the state $s_i$ is the initial state $s_0$ of this \BCN\ or not.
\begin{example}
For example, for the \BCN\ mentioned in {\em Example \ref{exa:2}}, we have for every initial state of this \BCN\ can be determined by an input sequence.  For instance,
\begin{itemize}
  \item the state $\delta_{16}^1$ can be determined by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^4$, $\delta_{4}^1 \delta_{4}^3$ or $\delta_{4}^1 \delta_{4}^4$, etc;
  \item the state $\delta_{16}^2$ can be determined by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^1$, $\delta_{4}^3$ or $\delta_{4}^4$, etc;
  \item the state $\delta_{16}^2$ can be determined by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^2$, $\delta_{4}^4$ or $\delta_{4}^1 \delta_{4}^4$, etc.
\end{itemize} 

Therefore we have this \BCN\ satisfies the existing first observability.
\end{example}   

\begin{definition}
	The second type of observability is that, a \BCN\ is called observable if for any distinct states $s_0$, ${s'}_0 \in \Delta_N$, there exists an input sequence $I\in(\Delta_M)^p$ for some $p\in \mathbb{Z}_+$, such that $Hs_0=H{s'}_0$ implies $(HL)^p_{s_0}(I)\neq (HL)^p_{{s'}_0}(I)$ \cite{Zhao2010Input}.
\end{definition}

The second observability means that a \BCN\ is called observable if for every two distinct initial states $s_0, s_0'$of the \BCN, there exists an input sequence $I$ which can distinguish them. 
\begin{example}
For example, for the \BCN\ mentioned in {\em Example \ref{exa:2}}, we have for every two distinct initial states of the \BCN, there exists an input sequence which can distinguish them.  For instance,
\begin{itemize}
  \item the states $\delta_{16}^1$ and $\delta_{16}^2$ can be distinguished by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^1$, $\delta_{4}^2 \delta_{4}^1$ or $\delta_{4}^2 \delta_{4}^2$, etc;
  \item the states $\delta_{16}^1$ and $\delta_{16}^3$  can be distinguished by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^2$, $\delta_{4}^3$ or $\delta_{4}^4$, etc;
  \item the states $\delta_{16}^2$ and $\delta_{16}^3$  can be distinguished by any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^1$, $\delta_{4}^2$ or $\delta_{4}^4$, etc.
\end{itemize} 

Therefore we have this \BCN\ satisfies the existing second observability.
\end{example}   
\begin{definition}
The third type of observability is that, a \BCN\ is called observable if there exists an input sequence $I\in(\Delta_M)^p$ for some $p\in \mathbb{Z}_+$, such that for any distinct states $s_0$, ${s'}_0 \in \Delta_N$, $Hs_0=H{s'}_0$ implies $(HL)^p_{s_0}(I)\neq (HL)^p_{{s'}_0}(I)$ \cite{Cheng2011Identification}.
\end{definition}

The third observability means that a \BCN\ is called observable if there exists an infinitely long input sequence which can determine the initial state $s_0$ of the \BCN\ for every $s_0\in\Delta_N$.

\begin{example}
For example, for the \BCN\ mentioned in {\em Example \ref{exa:2}}, we have there is an input sequence which can determine the initial state of this \BCN.  For instance, any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^1\delta_{4}^4\delta_{4}^1$ can determine the initial state $s_0$ of the \BCN\ for every $s_0\in\Delta_N$.

Therefore we have this \BCN\ satisfies the existing third observability.
\end{example}  
\begin{definition}
	The fourth type of observability is that, \BCN\ is called observable, if for any distinct states $s_0$, ${s'}_0 \in \Delta_N$, for any input sequence $I\in(\Delta_M)^{\infty}$, $Hs_0=H{s'}_0$ implies $(HL)^{\infty}_{s_0}(I)\neq (HL)^{\infty}_{{s'}_0}(I)$ \cite{Fornasini2013Observability}.
\end{definition}

The fourth observability means that a \BCN\ is called observable if every sufficient long input sequence can determine the initial state $s_0$ of the \BCN\ for every $s_0\in\Delta_N$.
\begin{example}
For example, for the \BCN\ mentioned in {\em Example \ref{exa:2}}, we have there exists at least one sufficient long input sequence that can not determine the initial state of this \BCN. For instance, the states $\delta_{16}^4$ and $\delta_{16}^5$  will convert into $\delta_{16}^{13}$ after being affected by $\delta_{4}^3$, therefore any input sequence which with the prefix $\delta_{4}^3$, they can not determine the initial state $s_0$ of the \BCN\ for every $s_0\in\Delta_N$.

Therefore we have this \BCN\ does not satisfy the existing fourth observability.
\end{example}  

What is more, we know the implication relationships of four existing types of observability from the definitions of them \cite{Zhang2016Observability}.

%\begin{proposition}
%The implication relationships of four existing types of observability.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The first observability implies the second observability, but the second observability does not imply the first observability.\\
%\item The third observability implies the second observability, but the second observability does not imply the third observability.\\
%\item The third observability implies the first observability, but the first observability does not imply the third observability.\\

%\item The fourth observability implies the first observability, but the first observability does not imply the fourth observability. \\
%\end{itemize} 
%\end{proposition}

Where the implication relationship is that ``The first observability implies the second observability.'' means ``If a \BCN\ satisfies the first observability then it satisfies the second observability.'' For the details of the proving process of this proposition, we refer readers to \cite{Zhang2016Observability}.
%, when we don't presuppose the initial state of {\em BCNs}
   
After introducing the definition of four existing observability and their implication relationship, we discuss how to determine the initial state of some \BCNs\ in real time by four existing types of observability. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The first and second observability can not help us to determine the initial state of some \BCNs\ in real time. Because in the first observability we need to assume that the initial state $s_0$ of a \BCN\ is $s_i$, and then check it by corresponding input sequence $I_i$ of this state. If the initial state we assume is correct, then we can determine the initial state $s_0=s_i$. But if the assumption is not correct, we can not determine the initial state of the \BCN. Therefore we need to check several test cases (with the same initial state $s_0$) of this \BCN\ untill we can determine the initial state of them. So do the existing second observability of \BCNs.
\item We can use the third existing observability and fourth existing observability to determine the initial state of \BCNs\ in real time, because we do not need to presuppose the initial state. But the requirements for \BCNs\ are very harsh when we use the third observability and fourth observability. Because we do not make full use of the output and input in the process of determining the initial state. The output of \BCNs\ we observed at every time step can help us further determine the range of the initial state. Then we can use different input sequence to determine the initial state based on the range of the initial state. However, in the third and fourth existing observability, we have to use the same input sequence to determine the initial state.
\end{itemize} 
 
In some biological systems (depicted by \BCNs), the initial state of them can be checked at most once, i.e., we can only check the initial state of some biological systems in real time. Therefore, we can not use the first observability and second observability to determine the initial states of them in real time. Moreover, in some biological systems, it would takes many costs to check these biological systems. Hence we will spend a lot of overhead to determine the initial states of them by the first observability and second observability. Furthermore, we also can not use the third observability and fourth observability to determine the initial states of some biological systems if they do not satify the requirements of the third and fourth observability. With these disadvantages of four existing observability, we propose the online observability of \BCNs\ to solve this problem.
 \subsubsection*{Problem}
Finding the necessary and sufficient condition of determine the initial state $s_0$ of \BCNs\ in real time for every $s_0\in \Delta_N$.
