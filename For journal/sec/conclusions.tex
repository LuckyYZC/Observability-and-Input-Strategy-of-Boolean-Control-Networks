%\section{CONCLUSIONS}

In this paper, firstly we proposed the online observability of \BCNs\ and define its mathematical form. Secondly we propose two algorithms based on the supertree and directed graph to determine the online observability. After that we present some optimization brought by the online observability to further illustrate its advantages. %use it to try to find the shortest path and avoid entering critical states when we determining the initial state of {\em BCNs}.

But even with the supertree-based algorithm and the algorithm based on directed graph, it is still hard to determine the online observability of large scale \BCNs. Therefore, in the future we will try to separate the \BCN\ into the subnets to determine their online observability respectively, and then determine the online observability of original \BCN. Furthermore, we also want to try to use some knowledge about formal methods to earn scalability for \BCNs. 

In addition to the theoretical aspect, the realistic application is also very important. Thus we will also try to find some realistic example which can be modeled by \BCNs. So that we can use the online observability to analyze them to gain better performance.
