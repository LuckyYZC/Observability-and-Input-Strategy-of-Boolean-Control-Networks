% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks -

% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\begin{abstract}
Determining initial states of Boolean control networks (\BCNs)  is import in many applications.  The existing 
four types of BCNs' observability  have been proposed to study the initial state of \BCNs. However, all of them are offline observability, meaning that
the input sequence is given before studying the \BCN's initial state and the input sequence  remains unchanged during the process of determining.
In this paper, we present an online observability which is more powerful in determining the initial state of \BCNs.
   For online observability,
    we can derive and decide input sequence one by one based on the feedback from the outputs of the network in every time step.
Moreover, we also propose determination algorithms and optimization by the online observability to further illustrate its advantages.
