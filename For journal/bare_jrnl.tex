% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\begin{abstract}
Four types of observability of Boolean control networks (\BCNs) have been proposed to solve different problems \tl{what are these?}. However, all of them are offline observability meaning that input sequence cannot be adjusted by observing the output sequence in the process of determining the \BCN's initial state. In this paper, we  propose the notion of online observability that can dynamically determine the \BCN's initial state in real time \tl{?}. The online observability accomplishes this task through deciding input sequence and observing the output sequence in every time step %which represents the discrete time. 
In some biological systems, this feature leads the online obsevability to determine the initial state compared with the offline observability \tl{?}. Furthermore, we also propose algorithms to determine the online observability of \BCNs.
