\begin{abstract}
Determining initial states of Boolean control networks (\BCNs)  is import in many applications. The existing  four types of BCNs' observability  have been proposed to study the initial state of \BCNs. However, all of them are offline observability, meaning that the input sequence is given before studying the \BCN's initial state and the input sequence  remains unchanged during the process of determining. In this paper, we present an online observability which is more powerful in determining the initial state of \BCNs. For online observability, we can derive and decide input sequence one by one based on the feedback from the outputs of the network in every time step. Moreover, we also propose determination algorithm for online observability.
%Moreover, we also propose determination algorithms and optimization brought by the online observability to further illustrate its advantages.
