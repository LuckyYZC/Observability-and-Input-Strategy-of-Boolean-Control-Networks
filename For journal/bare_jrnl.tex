\begin{abstract}
Determining initial states of Boolean control networks (BCNs)  is important in many applications. The existing  four types of \BCNs' observability have been proposed to present whether the initial state of \BCNs\ can be determined by different algorithms. In the existing observability, there are two main ways to determine initial state. The first one is by taking the determining procedure multiple times in parallel, and the second one is by taking the determining procedure once. In this paper, we present an observability named online observability to address the necessary and sufficient condition of determining initial state by taking the determining procedure once. %For online observability, we can derive and decide input sequence one by one based on the feedback from the outputs of the network in every time step. %Moreover, we also propose determination algorithm for online observability.
Moreover, we also propose determination algorithm and optimization brought by the online observability to further illustrate its advantages.
%However, all of them are offline observability, meaning that the input sequence is given before studying the \BCN's initial state and the input sequence  remains unchanged during the process of determining.
