\begin{abstract}

Four types of observability of Boolean control networks (\BCNs) have been proposed to solve different problems. However, all of them are offline observabilities that we can not adjust the input sequence by observing the output sequence in the process of determining the initial state of \BCNs. In this paper, we firstly propose the online observability that it can determine the initial state of \BCNs\ dynamically without presupposing its initial state. The online observability accomplishes this task by deciding input sequence and observing out sequence in every time step. The node values of \BCNs\ update at discrete time, then we use the time step to represent the discrete time. Compared with offline observabilities, the online obsevability can determine the initial state of some biological systems which can be checked at most once. %We define the concepts of deduce function, $K$ steps deterministic and the formal definition of online observability of BCNs. We also define the supertree and directed graph to determine online observability for BCNs.
